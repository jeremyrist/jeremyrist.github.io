##Reflection on Week 6:##

Week 6 was a tiring week but just when I was wearing down I was able to find a second wind. I didn't do it all myself, a large amount of credit goes to my friends Van Morrison, Miles Davis, and Merlot. We did it together.

The hardest assignment was using LODASH to pull out details from an API and insert them inside of double curly braces, also called "mustaches." {{}}

I feel like I learned a lot and made great progress on the basics of CSS and HTML. I even got more comfortable using JavaScript. With the help of my classmates and tutors I think I can do this! 

_Synopsis of Week 6's notes:_

* A function inside a function is a called a "callback"
* "Composition" is using the result of the function into another function and so on...
* `bower` installs things for the BROWSER
    * This gets you jQuery! 
* `npm` installs things for the COMMAND LINE
* "tar" is the nerdy version of "zip" files
* You can declare a variable in `.scss`
    * _example:_ $background-color: #FFF 
* Google analytics is at the bottom of the HTML
* `bower install --save lodash` is faster/smaller than jQuery, based on underscore
* You can link it in HTML like jQuery 
* You gotta link jQuery before you link your JS file/files so jQuery `<script>` goes above
* In the DOM every value can be represented by a STRING
    * _example:_ document.querySelector("h3").innerHTML
* `<section>` is a good replacement for `<div>`
* OCTICONS need a pseudo class `::before`
