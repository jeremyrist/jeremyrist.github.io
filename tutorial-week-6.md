What you will learn:
* How to make square images circular with `scss`

How to do it:
1. Place your image in your `html`

2. Give your image a height and width in `scss`

3. Make sure that the height and width are the same!

4. Change the border-raidus to 50%

2. `width: 5em;`
   `height: 5em;`

3. Make the height and width the same!
