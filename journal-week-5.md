##Reflection: Week 5 was crazy.

###Here's a summary of my notes:

* JS links go at the bottom of HTML to let other stuff load first

* Always put the library link above JS link.

* Design 101 - start with 3 colors: black, white, medium grey

* Design 101 - attention is the user's gift to you and it can be taken away

* .gitignore - throw .gitignore in the css folder when doing sass 

* APIs - endpoints are any URL that the API understands

* APIs - Postman is an API explorer

* node-sass - `node-sass current-file location-file`

* node-sass - example: `node-sass src/scss/main.scss src/css/main.css` (it's that simple)

* Key words are magic words

* Floating doesn't contribute to vertical height
