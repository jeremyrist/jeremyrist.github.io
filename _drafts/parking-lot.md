jQuery is a brand new thing that we learned today.
It's an external library.

And! 3 CSS properties that can affect layour are:
* Display: block, inline, flex, inline-block, none
* Float: left and right
* Position: relative, absolute, fixed

The default value for `display` depends on the element.
The default value for `float` is none.
The default value for `position` is relative.
