The second week of the Iron Yard featured significantly less freakouts than the first. I'm becoming more accustomed to the way things work around here. The style of teaching is for sure different than Brandeis, or even High School for that matter, but I'm starting to appreciate it for what it is: different. Thanks to the Growth Mindset video I'm okay with being involved in something different and I see it as a good thing. The power of "yet" is a very real power.

I like the flow of the class so far. I like the energy of the students and the teachers. Every now and then I struggle to pay attention and lose focus but that's just part of being a student. Honestly, I'm surprised I've been so engaged thus far. I'm not a very "techy" guy and there's a whole lot of other things going on in my life at the moment but I'm still able to lock in when I need to. All that time off of school did not exactly make me a more attentive person but it did make me more driven.

We learned a lot in the second week, unfortunately for me it didn't involve yak shaving stuff so I had to go back and re-learn the basics. I understand that yak shaving is incredibly important because if you do it wrong it will f**k up the whole enterprise. Correcting code is a simple and sometimes fun process, but correcting misplaced files and folders and whatnot is a drag. You need to yak shave properly so that the attention can be on the code and the logic and not other things.

Here are some bullet points from my week 2 notes:

* How do I alter control flow? 
* Loops, functions, conditions, PEMDAS  
* When you push you will see your changes and final code in github
* DOM is short for Document Object Model
* Object is synonymous with dictionary
* The HTML document is an object
* Therefore you can see it as a dictionary of the HTML identifying and defining diff parts in list form
* Progressive enhancement assumes you have nothing and uses javascript to make the experience better
* https stands for hypertext transfer protocl secure
* html stands for hypertext markup language
* href stands for hypertext reference
* a website consists of an "https" and a "host" and a "path"
