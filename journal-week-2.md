The second week of the Iron Yard featured significantly less freakouts than the first. I'm becoming more accustomed to the way things work around here. The style of teaching is for sure different than Brandeis or even High School for that matter but I'm starting to appreciate it for what it is: different. 

I like the flow of the class. I like the energy of the students and the teachers. Every now and then I struggle to pay attention and lose focus but honestly I'm surprised I've been so engaged so far. All that time off of school did not exactly make me a more attentive person. 

We learned a lot in the second week, unfortunately for me it didn't involve yak shaving stuff so I had to go back and re-learn the basics. I get the vibe that yak shaving is so important though because if you do it wrong it will f**k up the whole enterprise. Correcting code is a simple and sometimes fun process, but correcting misplaced files and folders and whatnot is a drag. 

Here are some bullet points from my week 2 notes:

* How do I alter control flow? 
* Loops, functions, conditions, PEMDAS  
* When you push you will see your changes and final code in github
* DOM is short for Document Object Model
* Object is synonymous with dictionary
* The HTML document is an object
* Therefore you can see it as a dictionary of the HTML identifying and defining diff parts in list form
* Progressive enhancement assumes you have nothing and uses javascript to make the experience better
* https stands for hypertext transfer protocl secure
* html stands for hypertext markup language
* href stands for hypertext reference
* a website consists of an "https" and a "host" and a "path"
