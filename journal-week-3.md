What did we do in week 3? 

This file is for topics that are related to your experience last week (week 2) but that don't fit into your main journal.

jQuery is a brand new thing that we learned today. It's an external library.

And! 3 CSS properties that can affect layour are:

Display: block, inline, flex, inline-block, none
Float: left and right
Position: relative, absolute, fixed
The default value for display depends on the element. The default value for float is none. The default value for position is relative.

"If applied this commit will..."

if (condition) {
  statements;
}

selector {
  property: value;
}

In CSS everything inherits from the Body tag, so it's a good place to start for default properties.

3 rules of the cascade:
1. Inheritance - some properties are inherited by the children
2. Specificity - if you increase specificity you can override inheritance, use more selectors or different selectors
3. Order - based on the entire rule, top to bottom, earlier rules get clobbered by later properties
