In CSS everything inherits from the Body tag, so it's a good place to start for default properties.

3 rules of the cascade:
1. Inheritance - some properties are inherited by the children
2. Specificity - if you increase specificity you can override inheritance, use more selectors or different selectors
3. Order - based on the entire rule, top to bottom, earlier rules get clobbered by later properties
