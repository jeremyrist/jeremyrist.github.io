### [Reflections on Week 1:](https://twitter.com/UFCONFOX/status/640332064651251712)

The first week at the Iron Yard was the hardest class I've ever taken. I've been out of school for a little over 3 years now and it is clear that I was out of shape. If you click on "Reflections on Week 1" you will see how the first couple days felt for me, metaphorically speaking. 

Thankfully I had done all of the pre-work and I at least had heard of most of the concepts but that was really all that I had. From primitive values to array methods, everything in between was new information. The immersive learning technique as well as the Socratic Method threw me off at first but by the end of the week I was more comfortable.

That was the running theme with almost everything as well. At the beginning of the week I was completely disoriented and lost but by the end I was starting to get more familiar and comfortable. So far I've really enjoyed all of my classmates and I think we're all really lucky to have two great instructors. I can't believe how hard that first week was but we're all still here and we're all still alive. I can't wait to see where we go!
