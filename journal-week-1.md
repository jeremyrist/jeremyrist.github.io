### [Reflections on Week 1:](https://twitter.com/UFCONFOX/status/640332064651251712)

The first week at the Iron Yard was the hardest class I've ever taken. I've been out of school for a little over 3 years now and it is clear that I was out of shape. If you click on "Reflections on Week 1" you will see how the first couple days felt for me, metaphorically speaking. 

Thankfully I had done all of the pre-work and I at least had heard of most of the concepts but that was really all that I had. From primitive values to array methods, everything in between was new information. The immersive learning technique as well as the Socratic Method threw me off at first but by the end of the week I was more comfortable.

That was the running theme with almost everything as well. At the beginning of the week I was completely disoriented and lost but by the end I was starting to get more familiar and comfortable. So far I've really enjoyed all of my classmates and I think we're all really lucky to have two great instructors. I can't believe how hard that first week was but we're all still here and we're all still alive. I can't wait to see where we go!

Here are some of my main takeaways from Week 1:

 * _we break things and occasionally fix them_
  
 * _node is how you use javascript not on a website_
  
 * _node is a REPL (read evaluate print loop)_
  
 * _4 primitive values: null, Boolean, Number, Strings_
 
 * _smashing things together is concatenation_

 * _[mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is the place to go for javascript reference manual_
 
 * _an expression is any piece of a statement_
 
 * _a program goes from statement to statement_
 
 * _the control flow is how you go from statement to statement, top-down/left-right_
 
 * _function is a snippet of code that when told to do its job executes everything inside the curly braces_
 
 * _you can't invoke a function that hasn't been defined_
 
 * _an expression has a right and a left, one side is an operand and the other side is another operand, the operator is in the middle_
 
 * _the default value every function returns is undefined_
 
 * _package.json is how you npm test, npm init will help you get a package.json file_
