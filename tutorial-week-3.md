## Grid-Based Layout:

* In this brief tutorial we will talk about the Grid-Based Layout. 

* This term is meant to describe what you get when you use CSS to design a web page. 

* The grids can also be referred to as boxes since they literally look like rectangles or squares. 

* All you can do with CSS is move boxes around. But before you can do that you need to first identify the boxes so you can know what you're doing! 

* A good way to do this and learn about the Grid-Based Layout is to use the `inspect element` function that's already loaded in your web browser.

* When you click `inspect element` you are shown the HTML of the webpage and can see what `id` or `class` or `element` or whatever you clicked on, you can learn more about it.

* If you're into abstract art then the image below is for you. It's an abstract way of looking at a webpage.
