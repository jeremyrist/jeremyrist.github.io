## Grid-Based Layout:

#### So what's the deal with web pages? How do they look like that? How is everything balanced on the page?

* In this brief tutorial we will talk about the `Grid-Based Layout`. 

* This term is meant to describe a design method, like a way of organizing your webpage.

* The "Grids" in `Grid-based Layout` can also be referred to as boxes since they look like rectangles or squares. 

* All you can do with `CSS` is move boxes around. But before you can do that you need to first identify the boxes so you can know what you're doing! 

* A good way to do this and learn about the `Grid-Based Layout` is to use the `inspect element` function that's already loaded in your web browser.

* #### `Inspect Element` is a developer tool that lets you see the `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` of a page.

* When you click `inspect element` you are shown the `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaSript` of the webpage and can see what `id` or `class` or `element` or whatever you clicked on.. you can learn more about it.

* If you're into abstract art then the image below is for you. It's a way of looking at a webpage.

* All websites really are is a series of boxes with information inside them!
