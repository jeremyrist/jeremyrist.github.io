This is the rough outline of the diggity dog.

Man, what a day. A lot of this work is extremely overwhelming but when it's put in the context of "The Right Mindset" it all makes sense. Of course this is hard -- it's supposed to be. Of course it's not all going to click at once -- I'm not a genius.

I really like the idea that not knowing something is actually a good thing, not a bad thing. Not knowing something means that there is potential to learn. Not knowing something is never a permanent condition, it's a sign that more information needs to be acquired. I like that a lot. Carol Dweck pointed out evidence that showed that a simple mentality switch on this issue could actually reverse things, like the achievment gap, that were previously thought to be irreversible.

Major themes from the Carol Dweck TED Talk:

Learning is better when you understand that there is no such thing as "I'm a failure," but instead only "I haven't gotten there yet."

Anyone can learn anything.

A big secret to successful learning seems to be earnest, self-motivated effort.

She was great but probably the last person you wanna get stuck with at a cocktail party...

Carol Dweck uses the term "Growth Mindset" while we are using "Right Mindset."

Here are the characteristics of a "Growth Mindset":

embraces challenges
persists in the face of setbacks
sees effort as the path to mastery
learns from criticism
finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others
I must admit that I do not always nobly follow these bullet points, I wish I did but I don't. But I guess part of the thinking with a Growth Mindset is embracing challenges and one of the first challenges of this course will be embracing the challenge of accepting a Growth Mindset, or the Rigt Mindset, instead of a Fixed Mindset.

Outline:
Thesis - A student's learning efforts should focus on the Right Mindset because it allows most individuals to learn in the most effective way without damaging their spirit.
